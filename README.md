# 📸 Mesto

**Mesto** is a responsive single-page web application that allows users to manage a travel-themed photo gallery. Users can edit their profile information, update their avatar, add or delete photo cards, and like cards. All data is handled through interaction with an external REST API. The interface includes animated popups and client-side form validation.
